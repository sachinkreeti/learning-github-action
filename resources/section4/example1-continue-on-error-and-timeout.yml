# when one step fails, next steps will not run
# we can use continue on error there
# if: failure(), when added to one step will run that step in case of failure
# but it will not run all the step
# add continue-on-error to the step you want to ignore error for

# timeout - can be added to job or step
# 360 => 360 minutes
